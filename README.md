# task-management-project
Task management productivity application using Node.js

Description:
A secure, team-based Task Management API built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, featuring user authentication, task CRUD operations, and rate-limited motivational quotes.

Assumptions:
- Tasks are user-specific and protected via JWT.
- One user per account (no team-sharing implemented).
- Quotes endpoint is protected and rate-limited per user.
- MongoDB is used without sharding or replica sets for now.

Some implementations if we are scaling to 100K Users:

- Horizontal Node.js instances behind a load balancer (NGINX).

- Use Redis for session store (if refresh tokens added).

- Sharded MongoDB cluster for data partitioning by user ID.

- Caching for static content; Redis for frequently used data.

Production Readiness:

- Ensure all user inputs are validated (e.g., required fields) and sanitized to prevent harmful data (like scripts).
- All secrets (JWT keys, DB URLs) are stored in a .env file and never hardcoded in the code.
- API errors return clean, helpful messages without exposing server internals. Errors are logged for debugging.
- Proper indexing helps fast retrieval of tasks, especially when scaling.
- In production, the app can be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across machines.
